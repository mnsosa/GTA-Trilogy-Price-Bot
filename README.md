# GTA Trilogy Price

It's just an excuse to do GitScraping and to use the Tweepy library.

(Not gonna lie, I really want to buy the GTA Trilogy, but the price is high af)

## What this project has to do
1. Scrape the price data ☑️
2. Automate it using GitHub actions ☑️
3. Publish results on Twitter (waiting for _Twitter Developer Account_ confirmation) ◻️

Today I wanted to add info to the scraper by scraping Steam. When I opened it I saw this:

So I bought it. I feel good.
