# GTA Trilogy Price

It's just an excuse to do GitScraping and to use the Tweepy library.

(Not gonna lie, I really want to buy the GTA Trilogy, but the price is high af)

## What this project has to do
1. Scrape the price data ☑️
2. Automate it using GitHub actions ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62484139/223881808-a98aa317-8b5b-4a13-9424-d0cb41892111.png)
3. Publish results on Twitter (waiting for _Twitter Developer Account_ confirmation) ◻️
