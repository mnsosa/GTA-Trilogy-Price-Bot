# GTA Trilogy Price

It's just an excuse to do GitScraping and to use the Tweepy library.

(Not gonna lie, I really want to buy the GTA Trilogy, but the price is high af)

## What this project has to do
1. Scrape the price data :check:
2. Automate it using GitHub actions: check:
3. Publish results on Twitter (waiting for _Twitter Developer Account_ confirmation)
